# Whatsapp_Chat_Analyzer-Project-
During PGDAI Course from CDAC Noida , We have worked on this project which comes out to be successful .We have also deployed our project on the HuggingFace space.
#PROBLEM STATEMENT

WhatsApp-Analyzer is a statistical analysis tool for WhatsApp chats. Working on the chat files that can be exported from WhatsApp it generates various plots showing,
for example, which other participant a user responds to the most. Communication between people using the internet becomes part of their daily life. People used to 
communicate with each other using the online chat system to transfer their messages.We propose to employ dataset manipulation techniques to have a better understanding 
of WhatsApp chat present in our phones.It shows most used emoji and words which are repeated most times and also sentiment between the chats. It tracks our conversation
and analyzes how much time we are spending.

#OBJECTIVE

1.This project aims to provide a better understanding towards various types of chats. This analysis proves to be better input to machine learning models which
essentially explore the chat data. It requires proper learning instances which provides better accuracy for these models. Our project ensures to provide an in-depth
exploratory data analysis on various types of WhatsApp chats.
2.Exporting a text file of a whatsapp chat does not require a lot of space and internet data.
3.The metrics include the average number of messages per user, total messages, total users, average user time, most active user, word cloud, showing busiest day and 
analysis by date of chats and more.
4.WhatsApp chat analyzer is more focused on emojis and words than other metrics but no less fun than other WhatsApp chat analyzers.
5.This application does not store data on the server. It ensures privacy and security of users' chat.
